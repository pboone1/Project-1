                        Daya is one of the most beautiful people I have ever met, both inside and out. She radiates kindness to all of those around her. She is incredibly humble and talented. She has such a big heart and loves all of her friends so deeply. She became one of my first friends in our foundation studios and I would not trade her for the world. Her smile is infectious and I am lucky to know her.
