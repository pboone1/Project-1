                        Abigail Cade is the girl I always wished I had met at college. I saw her for the first time last year at portfolio review and I had no idea who she was. The first day of sophomore year, she walked in studio and sat across from me. That’s when I knew I met someone amazing. She is so inviting to everyone around her. She is precious and pure of heart. I have never felt so loved and welcomed than I do in her presence. Abigail Cade is the friend every girl wishes they had.
