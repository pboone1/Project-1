                    Cecily Husband is the physical embodiment of an angel. I met her in an elevator the minute my parents dropped me off freshman year. She was on the phone, but still said hi and I never saw her again. A month later, she showed back up and needed a date to her date party. I went and never looked back. She is the kindest soul I have ever met. I have watched her grow so much over the past two years and she is going to grow up to be such a wonderful human being.
