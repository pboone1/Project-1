                    <p> overall, my loved ones fuel my heart and soul. all of my favorite songs have a connection to people in my life. this zine is a collection of the love, music, and energy that keeps me going when times are tough. in the words of edward bulwer-lytton,  "music, once admitted to the soul, becomes a sort of spirit and never dies." the songs in this collection have definitely been admitted to the soul and their spirits will never die.
