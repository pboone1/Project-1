                        Ryan Vanella might be the friend I have known the longest. From preschool until now, we have grown up together. He was always in and out of my life, but he is definitely a friend for the ages. He is funny and blunt. Although frequently out-of-pocket, he will always make you laugh, but he is still great for a three in the morning deep conversation. He also is a mean parallel-parker, but do not trust him to drive around pregnant women. He has a tendency to hit them accidentally.
